1) -- kubectl edit pod // this edit does'nt allow to edit some of the components in the pod
                        So copy the file in another new yaml file and edit the same file and use create command to create the pod
2) -- kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml >&nbsp;my-new-pod.yaml //this command will copy the pod original yaml file into 
                                                            my-new-pod.yaml file
3) -- kubectl delete pod webapp //we can delete the pod which was initially created 
4) -- kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml //recreate the same pod using yaml file where the pod details is saved 
5) -- kubectl edit deployment my-deployment // similar for deployments
6) -- kubectl get deployment my-deployement -o yaml >&nbsp;my-deployment.yaml
